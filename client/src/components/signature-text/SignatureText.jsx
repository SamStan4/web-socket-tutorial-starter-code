            The image you see on the right is a representation of our professor every morning, right before his much-needed 
            coffee that helps thaw him out a bit. Imagine having to wake up at 4 or 5 AM in the dead of winter just to prepare 
            for class. Technically, since the sun hasnâ€™t even risen yet, can we really call 4 AM "morning"? The frigid cold, 
            combined with the mental fog of early hours, is an unfair battle both for students and faculty alike. No one should have 
            to endure sub-zero temperatures just to attend an 8 AM lecture. Morning brain freeze inevitably leads to null pointer exceptions 
            in our heads! For these reasons, we humbly request the administration to consider shifting CPTS 489 to a more humane afternoon time slot.
